## Data Selection 
----------------------------------------------------------
This file describes the data selected, transformed and generated during the "Getting and Cleaning Data Course" project.  The main goal was to transform (summarize) the original data collected from an accelerometers to a tidier format. 

A completed descriptions of the original variables and about the experiments carried out with a group of 30 volunteers performing six activities wearing a smartphone on the waist can be found at the zipped file ‘Original_info_files.zip’ with the original files ‘features.txt’ (List of all features),’ features_info.txt’ (Information about the variables) and ‘README.txt’. 

Following a resume of how these original variables were obtained. The original data selected for the project come from the experiment carried out with a group of 30 volunteers (19-48 years) performing six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using an embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, that captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been also video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers were selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. Subsequently, these time domain signals were processed by many different approaches, like filtering, noise removing, separation in to body and gravity signals, deriving to obtain Jerk signals, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). These signal processing methods generated other new signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ, tGravityAcc-XYZ, tBodyAccJerk-XYZ, tBodyGyro-XYZ, tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ, tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag, fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccMag, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag)

A description of the set of variables estimated from these signals can be found at the original file ‘features_info.txt’ zipped at the file ‘Original_info_files.zip’. The complete list of variables of each feature vector is available in 'features.txt' zipped at the file ‘Original_info_files.zip’. For the "Getting and Cleaning Data Course project” only the Mean and Standard deviation were selected. 

## For each record it is provided at the original data:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

These records were grouped into the train and test data set totalizing 7352 and 2947 records respectively. The train and test original records were then combined together on one table with 10299 records and 561 variables. The descriptive activity names (e.g. ‘walking’) listed at the ‘activity_labels.txt’ file were assigned to the original code data to have a more descriptive data. The appropriated descriptive variable names were assigned to the ‘totalLabelActivityData’ table (02 variables), SubjectData table (01 variable) and ‘totalData’ table (561 variables).

Among all the variables at the data set (‘totalData’) only the ones with mean (mean()) and standard deviation (std()) measurements were selected by the grep function from the R program, resulting on a table with 10299 records and 66 variables.  The ‘totalSubjectData’, ‘totalLabelActivityData’ and ‘totalData (only selected mean and std attributes) were combined together on a final table (‘finalData’) with 10299 records and 68 variables. Finally the ‘finalData’ table were transform in a new table were the variables were reorganized. So first of all, the data were grouped by the ‘SubjectCode’, ‘ActivityLabel’ variables. Then each remaining variables were summarized by computing their mean values. The final summarized tidy data will present the mean of the different 66 variables (only the mean and std measures) computed for each of the 30 subjects at the 6 different activities in a table with 35 records and 68 variables. This final summarized table was written in to the "summarizedFinalTable.csv" file.

## Following a list of the final 68 variables generated by the R structure function with theirs variable names, formats and sample of the respective record values:
